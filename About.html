								<h3>About Me</h3>
								<p>My name is Keith Guinn. I am a full-stack developer with a background in Psychology (B.A.), Social Work (MSW), and Information Technologies (A.S.).</p>
								<p>Why full-stack development, you ask? What do I bring to the table? I won't make this too long, <strong>I promise.</strong></p>
								<p>Well, my reason is similar to the reason I chose social work. You see, when I got out of the military I really wanted to be a Clinical Psychologist. I was fascinated with research, academia, mental health, and stats (even though I've never been the greatest with stats).
									During my undergraduate degree, I received hands-on experience in psychological research (see one of my independent studies here if you're interested in the relationship between videoconferencing and social anxiety) and began to work in mental health.	
									Upon finishing my undergraduate degree under the mentorship of a pretty awesome clinical psychologist (that now works for pluralsight conducting psych research on developers), I felt as though social work would best suit me, as I like to learn a lot about a lot of things and social work is a very broad field with a multitude of paths that can be taken.
									Social workers are trained in systems theory. As such, we're able to identify and examine the relationships between several systems and how they relate to a person's well-being, mental health, and societal outcomes. We do this by working in a plethora of settings (e.g., hospitals, hospice, inpatient/outpatient psychiatric facilities, schools, courts, law enforcement, etc.).
									Similarly, full-stack development encompasses a multitude of knowledge surrounding front-end and back-end development.
								</p>
								<p>As a user of the internet, and a (still currently licensed) mental health professional, I bring a unique perspective to the table. I am passionate about creating applications that are user-friendly, accessible, and that make a difference in the lives of others.
									If there's anything that being a social worker has taught me, it's the ability to adapt to an ever-changing and demanding environment with minimal resources available.
								</p>
